Changing property values in OBJECTs and ARRAYs.

SIMPLE SHOPING CART

When you add from all products to your cart, stock decreases and other way around.
When you press Ship, you initial state changes to new stock.

For each example I use 3 components.
1) App - where initial state is displayed
2) Home - where you can add and delete from cart
3) Cart - a) where you can add and delete from cart b) where you can ship and change initial state
I am rendering all components on same page for better understanding.
